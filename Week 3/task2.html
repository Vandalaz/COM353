    <h1>Task 2 - Hands on with JS</h1>

    <h3>myAge = “My age is” + “ ” + myAge ";</h3>
    <p>Initial explanation: <i>N/A.</i></p>
    <p id="result1">Placeholder</p>
    <p><i>Explanation: The value of myAge is a string "My age is 49". </i></p>
    <script>
        var myParagraph = document.getElementById('result1');
        myParagraph.innerHTML = myAge;
        myParagraph.style.color = 'Red';
    </script>

    <h1>Additional Statements</h1>

    <h3>myAge ++;</h3>
    <p>Initial explanation: <i>Increment (Postfix) operator that simply increase myAge by 1. It is now 50.</i></p>
    <p id="result2">Actual Result:</p>
    <p>Explanation: <i>In Task 1, myAge was an integer the entire time. Here we are trying to increment a string which results in NaN.</i></p>
    <script>
        myAge++;

        var myParagraph = document.getElementById('result2');
        myParagraph.innerHTML = myAge;
        myParagraph.style.color = 'Red';
    </script>

    <h3>myAge == 40+10</h3>
    <p>Initial explanation: <i>This is an comparison operator that checks if myAge's value is equal to 50 (40 + 10).
            While this would be true, the result is not assigned anywhere.</i></p>
    <p id="result3">Actual Result:</p>
    <p>Explanation: <i>Since myAge is now equal to NaN (Not a Number), the value is not equal to 50 and thus the result
            is false.</i></p>
    <script>
        myAge == 40 + 10;

        var myParagraph = document.getElementById('result3');
        myParagraph.innerHTML = myAge;
        myParagraph.style.color = 'Red';
    </script>

    <h3>myAge &lt=38;</h3>
    <p>Initial explanation: <i>Another comparison operator, this time the code is checking if myAge
            is less than or equal to 38. Is it not so the result would be false.</i></p>
    <p id="result4">Actual Result:</p>
    <p>Explanation: <i>Since myAge is now equal to NaN (Not a Number), the value is not less than or equal to 38 throws NaN.</i></p>
    <script>
        myAge <= 38;

        var myParagraph = document.getElementById('result4');
        myParagraph.innerHTML = myAge;
        myParagraph.style.color = 'Red';
    </script>

    <h3>myAge =40;</h3>
    <p>Initial explanation: <i>Here, we assign the value of 40 to myAge.</i></p>
    <p id="result5">Actual Result:</p>
    <p>Explanation: <i>myAge is set to an integer with value 40.</i></p>
    <script>
        myAge = 40;

        var myParagraph = document.getElementById('result5');
        myParagraph.innerHTML = myAge;
        myParagraph.style.color = 'Red';
