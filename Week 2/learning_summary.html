            <h1>What I learnt this week</h1>

            <h2>Task 0</h2>
            <p style="color: red">I went back and made my website accessible...</p>

            <h2>Task 1</h2>
            <p>I began this week by adding the supplied Task 1 material to my 'content' div.<br>
                Then I downloaded 2 photos to use for the JavaScript events.<br>
                At this point, I did some reading about these particular events on W3 to learn how they work.</p>
            <p>I also learned about the Document Object Model or DOM for short. This is an internal roadmap of objects on a web page.<br>
                By using the document object in our scripts, we can access elements of the webpage.</p>

            <h2>Task 2</h2>
            <p>I added an unordered list with 3 items. Each of these was the name of a colour.</p>
            <p>By adding mouseover events to each of these list items, I could change the colour based on the users selection.</p>
            <p>I added a mouseleave event on the unordered list element itself so that the main content div would return to white after the user was finished playing about.</p>
            <p>2 of these events were created with the colour name and 1 was created using the rgb function.</p>
            
            <h4>With Colour Name:</h4>
            <p>onmouseout="document.getElementById('content').style.backgroundColor = 'White';"</p>
            
            <h4>With RGB:</h4>
            <p>onmouseover="document.getElementById('content').style.backgroundColor = 'Gray';"</p>

            <h2>Task 3</h2>
            <p>And here we are for Task 3, updating the learning log!</p>
